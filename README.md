# Everyone playing Outer Wilds in the same universe at different times!

## Harnessing the power of the Ash Twin Project I have managed to pluck hearthians from all different timelines into a singular, ~~buggier~~ one!

Essentially everyone is playing through their own loop, and broadcasting their positions and chat to each other to simulate a multiplayer experience.
In the future I plan to sync certain things, such as rafts. Things to have fun with together!

Once the mod is downloaded, press the CONNECT TO SERVER button and you should load into the multiplayer game.

Known bugs during connection process:
- Pressing connect multiple times will result in failure, in case of this restart the game and press connect once.

If a bug occurs, either create an issue here for me to see or ping me @Vesper on the Discord.

Thanks for reading and I hope you have fun!
